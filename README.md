# .dotfiles

To setup, first clone this repo with the `--recursive` flag so that sub-modules are checked out

```shell
git clone git@github.com:davezuch/.dotfiles.git --recursive
```

Then run the setup script

```shell
sudo sh setup.sh
```

## todo
Some paths are hardcoded to my home directory (`/home/david`), I should grep for those and fix them
